# Frontend Test

The goal of the test is simple, develop an application with listing and detail of all characters in the movies of the Star Wars saga.

It is missing some information about the test, the idea is to see how you handle in these situations to get the job done.

## List page:

List all Star Wars saga characters.

Pagination.

Must contain a filter by name and an option for advanced filter:
height, mass, hair_color, skin_color, eye_color, birth_year, gender.
(a modal or any other way that best suits the situation)

## Detail page:
It should contain all the information of the character, its specie and descriptions about the films that participated.

Hint:

* All details about design, technology, coding, architecture and more. They all will be analyzed and calculated with scores that can make the difference to chosen the professional that best fits with our needs.
